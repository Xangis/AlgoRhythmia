Changes still needed:

Add General MIDI level 2 drum sounds to MIDI drum list.

Changes from AlgoRhythmia Version 4 to 4.1 (August 2016):

1) Replaced entire sample set of 76 files with one ENTIRELY from freewavesamples.com,
with 102 samples, AND with names identical to those from FWS instead of those weird
DOS-style filenames we had.

2) Updated various libraries to more recent versions (wxWidgets, for example).

Changes from AlgoRhythmia Version 3 to 4:

1) Replaced the DirectMusic sound generation engine with XAudio2. DirectMusic
is no longer supported by Microsoft and does not work on 64-bit systems. 
AlgoRhythmia 4 now works on 64-bit Windows.
2) User interface was modified to properly handle the 125% zoom level on Windows 
7 and Vista.
3) Added more samples to the full version.

Changes version 2 to 3:

1) Added Fibonacci, Sierpinski, and Sierpinski inverted to base pattern list.
2) Converted application to use wxWidgets.
3) Kick sample (first sample) also plays when 'kick on first beat' is selected.
4) *Added save and load of settings.
5) *Added ability to edit individual drum notes on a grid.
6) Added swing setting.
7) Added volume setting for individual samples which affects both MIDI and sample volume.
8) *Added 58 samples recorded from the Yamaha TG-55 tone generator.
9) Now accepts mutation rate values of 0.
10)*Added ability to save to MIDI.
11)*Added 8 different effect types: Chorus, compression, distortion, echo, flange, 
gargle, parameteric eq, and reverb

Changes version 1 to 2:

1) Added invert buttons.
2) Changed from fixed drum sounds to user-selectable drum sounds.
3) Switched to a multithreaded model so that changes could be made
to settings without causing playback to stop or stutter.
4) Added sample playback.
5) Added ability to select MIDI channel and device.
6) Added mutation every X bars.
7) Added display and hand-editing of pattern data.
8) Added ability to vary volume to make pattern sound vaguely more "Human".
9) Added "emphasize beats" option to emphasize the one beat of each measure.
   Technically it actually de-emphasizes every other beat.
10) Added base patterns so that drum beats could be initialized with "normal"
   sounding beats and tweaked from there.
