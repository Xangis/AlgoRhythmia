It is an 8-channel drum machine and beat generator. It supports .wav sample playback 
and MIDI. It generates patterns up to 4 measures long in any of six time signatures 
and at virtually any BPM. It allows the user to mutate or regenerate any or all of 
the drum sounds in a pattern or to edit them by hand via the pattern editing window. 

This is a great creative tool for inspiring new ideas, practicing along to strange 
beats, or just tinkering for fun. With the addition of 8 built-in effects, customized 
or bizarre sounds are at your fingertips. With the ability to export patterns to MIDI, 
you can generate beats for use in your favorite sequencer or looping program.

AlgoRhythmia uses DirectX 9 (or newer). If you do not have DirectX 9, visit Microsoft's 
download site to download or update the DirectX redistributable.

A prebuilt installer for Windows is available in the installer folder.

No samples are included in this project. Your best source of free .wav samples is 
http://freewavesamples.com and that's where all of the original samples came from.
However, that site has far more samples than were ever included in AlgoRhythmia
thanks massive growth of the sample library in 2015.
